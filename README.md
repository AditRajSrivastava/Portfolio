About This Project
This portfolio was built from scratch using fundamental web technologies. It serves as a central hub for my professional presence, detailing my educational background, technical skills, and a curated selection of my most significant projects. The design is modern and dark-themed, with a focus on smooth animations and an engaging user experience.

Key Features
Interactive Background: A dynamic, animated background featuring floating orbs and a constellation effect that responds to mouse movement, built with the HTML Canvas API.

Animated "My Journey" Timeline: A unique and creative timeline designed as a railway track, with a train that moves down the track as the user scrolls.

Dynamic Project Showcase: An interactive grid of featured projects. Clicking "View Details" opens a pop-up modal with more information and links to the live demo and GitHub repository.

Smooth Scrolling & Animations: Scroll-triggered fade-in animations for all sections and smooth navigation between them.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

Simulated Contact Form: A functional-looking contact form that provides user feedback upon submission without requiring a backend.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the website.

CSS3: For all styling, including custom properties (variables), gradients, animations, and responsive design using media queries.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, including the background canvas animation, scroll effects, modal pop-ups, and the railway journey animation.

Font Awesome: For all icons used throughout the site.

Deployment
The site is deployed and hosted on Vercel.
